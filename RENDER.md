# Website2 (Render Deployment)

This branch contains the static files for deployment on Render.

## Deployment Instructions

1. In your Render dashboard, create a new "Static Site"
2. Connect to this GitHub repository
3. Select the `render` branch
4. Configure the following settings:
   - **Build Command:** `echo "No build needed - using pre-built static files"`
   - **Publish Directory:** `.` (root directory, note the single dot)
5. Click "Create Static Site"

## Important Notes

- The site is already pre-built and doesn't need a build step
- We've modified the package.json to skip the build process
- All static files are in the root directory, not in a dist or out subdirectory
- If you encounter any issues, please check the Render logs for details

The site will be deployed using the pre-built static files in this branch.
